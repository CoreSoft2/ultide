UltIDE
======

UltIDE is a general purpose IDE with a client-server architecture. It was initialy created for its `ultiflow` module,
whose purpose is to provide a general interface for easily managing flowcharts and generating code from them.

Please note this is an Alpha version of UltIDE that was released since multiple people asked to access it. This is still
WIP and basic features are missing. Backward compatibility is NOT guaranteed. Documentation is not up to par.

External contributions for features, documentation, or simply suggestion are very welcome. Don't hesitate to contact us
via the Issue tab.

Installation
------------
Python and flask must be installed.

On linux, it should look like this:
```
sudo apt-get install python python-dev
sudo apt-get install libffi-dev
sudo pip install flask flask_socketio flask-user
```

Is something missing or did you succeed to install it on other platforms ? Don't hesitate to contact us!
